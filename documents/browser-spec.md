# Component Name:  < Browser\>   #

# 1. Functional Description #

This component will appear under the App Bar when/if the user's browser is not compatible with
the Verto Communicator. It uses the BrowserInfo and (possibly a version of the BrowserVideoHeader). It uses four instances of the BrowserInfo component to display vertically the browser Icon, browser Link, browser Name, & browser Version - (WhiteLabel?).
All displayed text uses the FormattedMessage convention for react-itnl. The messages are in the browser.json file located in the 'messages' folder. This component will utilize the established theming convention for this project (light, dark, & default) as needed. Styles can be overridden through the style prop.
